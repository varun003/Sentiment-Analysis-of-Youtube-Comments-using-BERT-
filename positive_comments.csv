Kyle being a proud dad for 37 minutes 
Steiny needs to keep a puppy on a leash every time Hasbulla is around 
You guys put together such a good trip for Hasbulla! W NELK! 
All those guys were grateful for the trip y‚Äôall put together.  That‚Äôs cool as hellb

I love the joy and happiness Hasbullah has for his adventures and how he stays humble and excited for all the people he meets. Protect this man at all costs. I cried watching this. Thanks for making our week better.
"Favorite thing about Kyle... Yeah he's a great talent scout and all.. between: Stevewilldoit, Salim the dream, Steiny, Bradley Martyn, bringing Cousin Jay on board, and then all the editors and videographers.... But the coolest thing about it all with Kyle is: he brought his hometown friend onto Nelk.. the Sender Mr. Jimmy Gamble$!!! Stud!!! That guy's energy so contagious everytime Jimmy Gambles in a Full Send video, it just seems to be better. Good for you Kyle for bringing along the high school friend that you weren't willing to leave behind. That right there gives you the ability to sing those Drake songs.. I started from the bottom got the whole team here. Call is a boss, marketing genius, creative genius, and the talent all-in-one and Forbes is looking really hard at the leader of Nelk right now. When a person can take their goofy highschool friend and turn them into a superstar, it's easy to see that there is longevity in nelk boys full send. Not everybody can do with Jimmy Gambles does. Most valuable player, 2023, go ahead and give him the "
Hasbulla is a cure for depression. You can't not smile at the little guy.

Be first boys!!! Be first!! Jump on the private jet with the whole crew and be first to get the scoop. Manager Drew he's probably drunk right now so he probably doesn't even know. Shitty Manager Drew!!!, you better get on your job bro and get these boys out to see the Tate Brothers and get all the stories and message you can while you can. The Tate's cannot come to the NelkBoys but y'all can go meet them!!! Y'all might be one of the only crews with big enough balls to get on the private jet and give it a shot. Can you imagine Full Send being the first ones to talk to the Tate Brothers??!!!"
