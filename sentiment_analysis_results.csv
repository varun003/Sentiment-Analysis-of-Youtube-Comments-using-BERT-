"Favorite thing about Kyle... Yeah he's a great talent scout and all.. between: Stevewilldoit, Salim the dream, Steiny, Bradley Martyn, bringing Cousin Jay on board, and then all the editors and videographers.... But the coolest thing about it all with Kyle is: he brought his hometown friend onto Nelk.. the Sender Mr. Jimmy Gamble$!!! Stud!!! That guy's energy so contagious everytime Jimmy Gambles in a Full Send video, it just seems to be better. Good for you Kyle for bringing along the high school friend that you weren't willing to leave behind. That right there gives you the ability to sing those Drake songs.. I started from the bottom got the whole team here. Call is a boss, marketing genius, creative genius, and the talent all-in-one and Forbes is looking really hard at the leader of Nelk right now. When a person can take their goofy highschool friend and turn them into a superstar, it's easy to see that there is longevity in nelk boys full send. Not everybody can do with Jimmy Gambles does.
